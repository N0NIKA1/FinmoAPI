# FinmoAPI

I have used Eclipse as an IDE in here.
It is rest assured API automation project using BDD cucumber and Java.
I have used maven as a build tool and JUnit to run the test cases.
I have used POJO's for Request body and we have pom.xml to keep all the dependencies specified there.
In plugin's we need Natural, Eclipse m2e which we can download from Eclipse market place.
I have Feature files to keep the test cases under different features.
I have used APIResourse enum class to keep the resource URL's of API's.
I have kept BaseURL in global.properties file.
I have used test data builder class to send the data to request body using setters.
